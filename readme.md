Git Glitched
============

Deploy to Glitch with a single `git push`.

Setup
-----

- Fork the Git Glitched [GitHub repo](https://github.com/noise-machines/git-glitched).
- Create a new Glitch project.
- In the top left corner of Glitch, click {Your Project Name} ‚ùØ Advanced Options üóº ‚ùØ Import From GitHub.
- Enter the name of your forked repository as the repo to import.
- In the Glitch sidebar, click üóù .env. Set the `SECRET` environment variable. 
- In the top left corner of Glitch, click {Your Project Name} ‚ùØ Advanced Options üóº ‚ùØ Open Console üìü.
- [Generate a new ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key).
- Copy your newly-generated public key from `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
- [Set up that public key as a deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) for your forked GitHub repo.
- In your forked repo, [set up a webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/) to POST to `{your-project-name}.glitch.me/deploy?secret={your-secret}`. Make sure `{your-secret}` matches the `SECRET` environment variable you set earlier in your Glitch project.

Now when you push to the glitch branch of your repo, it will automatically get deployed to Glitch üéâ

> ‚ò†Ô∏è Be careful. This project only checks if the `secret` query param matches the `SECRET` environment variable. It will happily pull down any git repository, *including ones that don't belong to you*.
